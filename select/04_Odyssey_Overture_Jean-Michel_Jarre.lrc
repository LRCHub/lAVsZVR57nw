[00:03.11] Walking upside down in the sky...
[00:08.14] Between the satellites passing by... I'm looking...
[00:17.26] I'm looking for my dreams... smoking some golden beams...
[00:26.32] Gliding along the black rainbow... I fly away...
[00:35.23] With my shadow... while... scratching the moon like a DJ...
[00:45.13] The night follows... it's odyssey... phase 1.
